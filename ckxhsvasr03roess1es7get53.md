## ENS Domain

So today we will discuss the process of getting your ENS name but first let's see what is ENS.
## Introduction

Ethereum Name Service(ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. So in simple terms it maps human readable names like "helloworld.eth" to machine-readable identifiers such as addresses.  Imagine having to remember different addresses for all the different wallets that you interact with. **THANK GOD FOR ENS, RIGHT?**

ENS in a way works similar to the Internet’s Domain Name Service by providing human-friendly navigation For example, when you type google.com in your browser, it translates to an IP address. You can easily access a website by typing the correct IP address for it on your browser, but imagine what will happen if you had to remember IPs of all the sites you visit frequently. Therefore, it is easier to remember the name of the website using a URL and let DNS do the work for us by mapping it to the correct IP.

## How to get your ENS domain
- Make sure you have wallet like metamask and some ETH in it.  [**NAME IS NOT FREE**]
- Go to the https://ens.domains/ and click "go to app" on top right corner

- After selecting the years you can click on request to register. At this stage you will have to approve a transaction. First transaction.

- Once you approve the transaction it will move on to step 2 where it will check to ensure another person hasn’t tried to register the same name that you selected.

- Click ‘register’ and your wallet will re-open. Only after the 2nd transaction is confirmed you'll know if you got the name.

- Now you need to setup Primary ENS name. To do that click on account on the left pane then from the drop down select the ens name. Time for you to approve your third transaction.
